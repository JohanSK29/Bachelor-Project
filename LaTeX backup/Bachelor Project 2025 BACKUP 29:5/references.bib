abstract = {Abstract Prices are increasingly set by algorithms. One concern is that intelligent algorithms may learn to collude on higher prices even in the absence of the kind of coordination necessary to establish an antitrust infringement. However, exactly how this may happen is an open question. I show how in simulated sequential competition, competing reinforcement learning algorithms can indeed learn to converge to collusive equilibria when the set of discrete prices is limited. When this set increases, the algorithm considered increasingly converges to supra-competitive asymmetric cycles. I show that results are robust to various extensions and discuss practical limitations and policy implications.},

 abstract = {Increasingly, algorithms are supplanting human decision-makers in pricing goods and services. To analyze the possible consequences, we study experimentally the behavior of algorithms powered by Artificial Intelligence (Q-learning) in a workhorse oligopoly model of repeated price competition. We find that the algorithms consistently learn to charge supracompetitive prices, without communicating with one another. The high prices are sustained by collusive strategies with a finite phase of punishment followed by a gradual return to cooperation. This finding is robust to asymmetries in cost or demand, changes in the number of players, and various forms of uncertainty.},

abstract = {I exploit a new station-level, twelve-hourly price dataset to examine the strong retail price cycles in the Toronto gasoline market. The cycles appear similar to theoretical Edgeworth Cycles: strongly asymmetric, tall, rapid, and highly synchronous across stations. I test a series of predictions made by the theory about how firm behaviors would differentially evolve over the path of a cycle. The evidence is consistent with the existence of Edgeworth Cycles and inconsistent with competing hypotheses. While the cycles are an interesting phenomenon for study in their own right, the evidence has important policy and welfare implications.},

abstract = {As the economy digitizes, menu costs fall, and firms can more easily monitor prices. These trends have led to the rise of automatic pricing tools. We employ a novel e-commerce dataset to examine the potential implications of these developments on price competition. We provide evidence from an RDD that the immediate impact of automatic pricing is a significant decline in prices. However, repricers have developed strategies to avoid the stark competitive realities of Bertrand-Nash competition. By employing plausibly exogenous variation in the execution of repricing strategies, we find that 'resetting' strategies (which regularly raise prices, e.g., at night) effectively coax competitors to raise their prices. While the resulting patterns of cycling prices are reminiscent of Maskin-Tirole's Edgeworth cycles, a model of equilibrium in delegated strategies fits the data better. This model suggests that if the available repricing technology remains fixed, cycling will increase, and prices could rise significantly in the future.},

abstract = {Abstract The behavior of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms is shaped by how they learn about their environment. We compare the prices generated by AIs that use different learning protocols when there is market interaction. Asynchronous learning occurs when the AI only learns about the return from the action it took. Synchronous learning occurs when the AI conducts counterfactuals to learn about the returns it would have earned had it taken an alternative action. The two lead to markedly different market prices. When future profits are not given positive weight by the AI, (perfect) synchronous updating leads to competitive pricing, while asynchronous can lead to pricing close to monopoly levels. We investigate how this result varies when either counterfactuals can only be calculated imperfectly and/or when the AI places a weight on future profits. Lastly, we investigate performance differences between offline and online play.},

  abstract={Strategic decisions are increasingly delegated to algorithms. We extend previous results of the algorithmic collusion literature to the context of dynamic optimization with imperfect monitoring by analyzing a setting where a limited number of agents use simple and independent machine-learning algorithms to buy and sell a storable good. No specific instruction is given to them, only that their objective is to maximize profits based solely on past market prices and payoffs. With an original application to battery operations, we observe that the algorithms learn quickly to reach seemingly collusive decisions, despite the absence of any formal communication between them. Building on the findings of the existing literature on algorithmic collusion, we show that seeming collusion could originate in imperfect exploration rather than excessive algorithmic sophistication. We then show that a regulator may succeed in disciplining the market to produce socially desirable outcomes by enforcing decentralized learning or with adequate intervention during the learning process.},
